Some of my day-to-day scripts that are either useful or unembarassing enough to share with the rest of the world.  Mostly bash.

# usagelog_parser
A script I wrote for monitoring the time I spend on my laptop.  It reads in a log file (usage.log) which is generated from some simple acpi scripts that run when I open/close my lid, or boot/turn off my machine.
